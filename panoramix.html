In a time long ago, when the echoing chants of adventurous students resonated through the halls of knowledge, there existed a legendary concoction known as the Cauldron of Panoramix.
</br>
The ingredients, carefully selected for their potency, were as follows:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A liter of the Elixir of Strength,</li>
            <li>Three frothy mugs of the Brew of Spirits,</li>
            <li>A liter of budget Potion of Champions,</li>
            <li>Half a liter of raspberry or cherry syrup,</li>
            <li>A liter of an elixir known for its energizing properties.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
The art of preparation demanded a vessel of grandeur, a mighty cauldron where the elements would converge. With reverence, the alchemists poured the ingredients in a specific sequence - the Elixir of Strength first, followed by the Brew of Spirits, Potion of Champions, energizing elixir, and syrup. Each addition required finesse, a delicate pouring to minimize the creation's effervescence. There were whispered theories that the cauldron should be heated, but the sage wisdom of the Druid Panoramix, echoing through the corridors of time, cautioned against it. To prevent the unwanted departure of the precious vitamins, the concoction was left unheated.
</br>
And so, amidst the stirring of whispers and the flickering of learned discussions, the elixir emerged, potent and awaiting consumption.
</br>
Legend has it that only when chilled to perfection would this brew be served, a testament to the harmony of its components and the wisdom passed down through ages. As the vessel was presented, the air was filled with an electric anticipation, for in the Cauldron of Panoramix lay the promise of unforgettable nights and spirited revelry.
